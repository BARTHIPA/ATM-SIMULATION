# ATM Simulation

**ATM Simulation** is a project designed to emulate the functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This simulation covers essential banking operations, providing an interactive interface for users to perform tasks like cash withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, and PIN verification.

---

## **Features**
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with PIN verification.  
- **Balance Inquiry**: View the current account balance.  
- **Cash Withdrawal**: Withdraw a specified amount with balance checks.  
- **Cash Deposit**: Add funds to the account balance.  
- **Transaction History**: View a log of recent transactions.  
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs and provides user-friendly error messages.
